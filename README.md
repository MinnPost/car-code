# Collecting

We collect data from Github in order to aggregate it and view it in different ways, as well as for performance.  The scraper is aimed at being run on ScraperWiki due to its awesomeness and the face that we already have an account.

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. `export GITHUB_TOKEN=XXXXXX`
1. ` python collecting/collecting.py`
