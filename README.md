# Computer-aided reporting (CAR) Code

An aggregate look at the code being written in the journalism world.

# Collecting

We collect data from Github in order to aggregate it and view it in different ways, as well as for performance.  The scraper is aimed at being run on ScraperWiki due to its awesomeness and the fact that we already have an account.

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. `export GITHUB_TOKEN=XXXXXX`
1. ` python collecting/collecting.py`

# Web interface

It's HTML and stuff; no server-side bits.  A build process should be put in place to make front-end assets speedier.

# RSS

It would be so cool to have an RSS feed of projects.  This would require a server, maybe Heroku.
